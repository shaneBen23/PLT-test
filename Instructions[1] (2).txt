You are given two json files:
 - stock.json: contains objects which represent the starting stock levels for given SKUS
 - transactions.json: contains an array of transactions since the stock levels were recorded in `stock.json`
The objective is to create a function which is able to return the current stock levels for a given SKU by combining the data in these two files. These are the requirements.
- The function must match the following signature: `(sku: string) => Promise<{ sku: string, qty: number }>`.
- The function must read from the `stock` and `transactions` files on each invocation (totals cannot be precomputed)
- The function must throw an error where the SKU does not exist
- All code must be adequately tested
Notes:
- Transactions may exist for SKUs which are not present in `stock.json`. It should be assumed that the starting quantity for these is 0.



SKU = Stock keeping unit
